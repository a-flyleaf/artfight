    A technicolor lizardy-friemd that I’ve had since 2012, and his design has never ever *ever* been perfectly consistent but I have fun with it—and so have other people, with things like [making his dot markings look like **extra eyes**](../assets/img/roster/zero-bystarmoths.jpg) (by the lovely [starmoths](https://www.deviantart.com/starmoths)!) and [adding **glowy effects**](https://www.deviantart.com/serosthedragon/art/Gift-for-A-FlyLeaf-878643581). And now I invite y’all to do the same >;3
    
    Doesn’t have much lore but I roleplayed him briefly, and here’s the gist:
    - created in some sort of laboratory for unknown reasons; wholly organic, with no supernatural powers
    - naturally curious, playful, and trusting; skittish in threatening situations
    - basically just wanders around exploring the world, sticking his snout where it doesn’t belong
    - would probably love to meet you(r character/s)!
    - no seriously he’s like horse-sized or bigger he will give rides to the little ones

     transcription of the 2021 (last) sketchdump’s end note: “as you can see I pay very little attention to detail and hex color in this design. the most important aspects are the **shape** and **general palette**; variations welcome (+encouraged)!”
     
     the wings and feather patterns especially keep changing every other drawing <span style="display:inline-block;">¯\\\_( ᐛ )_/¯</span>

    A weird monster with an inconsistent number of eyes, limbs, and teeth. As of 2022 the mouths can move like a can opener [winged corkscrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsBsyZUiSYQ). Very pointy, very long; *go nuts* <span style="display:inline-block;">:V.V:</span>

    Sometimes appears with a human “host.” What’s their deal? Your guess is good as mine!

    genuinely have no idea what this thing is, but the ears are based on the [bat-eared fox](https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/bat-eared-fox). different interpretations welcome; you may draw them as traffic cones if you wish

    This was supposed to be a minor character in one of my projects, except I like the design a disproportionate amount /o\ I’m still not 100% sold on how they’ll appear in-story, but I wanted to add someone new to the roster for 2022 so <em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal">here</em>
    - A cocky adult human perpetually seen in a canid skull mask (only covers upper half). Sometimes wields a baseball bat.
    - Showy and confident. Talks the talk about teamwork, but would turn on an ally without regrets if deemed necessary. Likes winning, despises weakness, and invigorated by chaos.
    - In other words this is the person in <i>Among Us</i> who’s yelling “<em style="text-transform:uppercase; font-style:normal">sus</em>” at everyone at the slightest provocation.
    - Exists in a barren, sometimes-hazy hellscape that looks something like [this](https://artbreeder.b-cdn.net/imgs/318375766bb98460f5ee0288dd21.jpeg).
    
    <b>optional</b>: Also running around the setting are [horrible rabbit-monsters](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/you-got-games-on-your-phone-892877737) ([direct image link](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/assets/img/gallery/2021-09-24-600.jpg) for those without deviantArt accounts). Feel free to draw “wolf-skull” going all [Batter](https://off.fandom.com/wiki/The_Batter) on one. Or taking a selfie with one. Or… whatever you please, really~

    I *guess* you can take off the mask if you have an idea for it?? I genuinely have no clue what the rest of the face looks like. Go wild \o/
