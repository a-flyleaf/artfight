<h2>define:ArtFight</h2>
<div class="textbox"><p>ArtFight is a month-long art trading competition, in which participants earn points for drawing each others’ characters. More info on <a href="https://artfight.net/info/about" target="_blank">the official about page</a>!</p></div>

<h2>who’re you? why this site?</h2>
<div class="textbox">
	<p><a href="https://artfight.net/~NightAuctor" target="_blank">NightAuctor</a> on ArtFight, <a href="/" target="_blank">a-flyleaf</a> elsewhere! Digital artist, here for a good time, posts art almost exclusively to <a href="https://a-flyleaf.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">deviantArt</a> and/or my own site these days.</p>
	<p>2021 was my first year doing ArtFight and it was a <em>blast</em>. I don’t like that the onsite artist and attack info is inaccessible to guests, though, so I thought I’d show off art people made for me (and art I made for others) on my own pages!</p>
</div>

<h2>I drew something for you; I don’t want it here!</h2>
<div class="textbox">
	<p>Sorry about that! Contact me onsite or dA (links above; you’ll get a faster response on dA) and I’ll make a note your attack can only be viewed onsite.</p>
	<p>I’ll also take down any <b>offsite links</b> (social media, custom site) you don’t want here, no caveat.</p>
</div>

<h2>social media links broke</h2>
<div class="textbox"><p>Everything is up-to-date as of <b>September 25, 2021</b>; in the interest of not stalking people, I won’t be changing them unless contacted otherwise (see above).</p></div>

<h2>You drew something for me; what can I do with it?</h2>
<div class="textbox">
	<p>~Whatever you want~, my dude.</p>
	<p>No, seriously. Reupload to character galleries! Use in edits! Print it, trace it, crop it! I do not care. The <strong>only</strong> caveat is that I want credit for the original work, ideally not through ArtFight (due to aforementioned lack of guest viewing).</p>
</div>

<h2>-points at characters on the “<a href="{%include url.html%}/for-me">cool stuff people drew for me</a>” page- who is thaaaaat</h2>
<div class="textbox">
	<p>Original Characters Please Do Steal/Transform/Reinterpret/etc.™</p>
	<p>Basically the only thing I requested was, and will continue to be, that people <b>have fun with the designs</b>; I do not care about accuracy to the reference. So there’s lots of variation and I love it :D</p>
	<p>Maybe eventually I will get around to making a new page to actually showcase the characters proper. For now here’s some dA links:</p><ul>

		<li>blue kid & weirdass furry: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery/75431402/cringetober" target="_blank">from cringetober 2020</a></li>
