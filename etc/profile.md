  #### How NightAuctor Does the ArtFight Thing
  
  - Hello, I am here to have fun and draw for strangers <span style="display:inline-block;">:D</span>
  - I attack people **on a whim**. If I attacked you out of nowhere, I might‚Äôve found you offsite, through random/recent/tagged characters, other people‚Äôs attacks or defenses, etc.
  - I **do not expect revenge**! I see lots of preemptive apologies so I figured I‚Äôd put this out there.
  - If you *do* draw for me, I wanna see **how *you* interpret the designs**, and do <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">not</em> care about accuracy to the reference. Go nuts! Redesign them! Draw them with your characters! Unless otherwise noted in the character permissions, anything goes.
  
  #### offsite art usage notes
  - <u>My attacks for you</u>: Do **whatever you want**! Reupload, edit, s‚Äôall good. Whenever possible, please credit me through [deviant<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Art</span>](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor), by name* if not link.¬†(*<i>NightAuctor</i> and <i>a-flyleaf</i> both work, up to you)
  - <u>Your attacks for me</u> (and also my attacks for you): I would like to show them off so people without ArtFight accounts can see them! So I made [a webpage](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/artfight/) to feature all the art from this event. Think of it like a toyhou.se gallery, except 100% custom-coded and publicly-viewable.
  - All sources will be linked whenever possible. If there‚Äôs a specific social media handle you want credited, or you *don't* want a piece shared for whatever reason (no need to disclose), please **let me know**!

## character permissions

I Would Prefer Not To See It
- realistic gore, or guts in general
- nudity or suggestive content
- super flashy gifs (minor or slow flickering is a-ok)
