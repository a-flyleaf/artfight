See [Toyshelf](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/toyshelf) for art by yours truly, and more up-to-date info in general! (Not linking character pages directly because, at the time of writing, my organization over there is a biiiit of a mess and extremely subject to change.... <span style="display:inline-block;">>_>\"</span>)

Names link to ArtFight character pages.

<!--could really use data for this.... although the cringetober duo is grouped for now, I like that
on the other hand, Completionism,,-->

## [Zero](https://artfight.net/character/1439410.zero)
> A technicolor lizardy-friemd that I’ve had since 2012, and his design has never ever *ever* been perfectly consistent but I have fun with it—and so have other people, with things like [making his dot markings look like **extra eyes**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/350353682489147393/521831635738558467/IMG_20181210_233027.jpg]) (by the lovely [starmoths](https://www.deviantart.com/starmoths)!) and [adding **glowy effects**](v). And now I invite y’all to do the same >;3
> 
> Doesn’t have much lore but I roleplayed him briefly, and here’s the gist:
> - created in some sort of laboratory for unknown reasons; wholly organic, with no supernatural powers
> - naturally curious, playful, and trusting; skittish in threatening situations
> - basically just wanders around exploring the world, sticking his snout where it doesn’t belong
> - would probably love to meet you(r character/s)!
> - no seriously he’s like horse-sized or bigger he will give rides to the little ones

## ["sawface"](https://artfight.net/character/1416800.sawface)
> A weird monster with an inconsistent number of eyes, limbs, and teeth. As of 2022 the mouths can move like a can opener [winged corkscrew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsBsyZUiSYQ). Very pointy, very long; *go nuts* <span style="display:inline-block;">:V.V:</span>
> 
>  Sometimes appears with a human “host.” What’s their deal? Your guess is good as mine!

Not shown: makes a small cameo in [an attack I drew](http://localhost:4000/for-you#art-29)!

## cringetober duo: [toolbelt kid](https://artfight.net/character/1415042.toolbelt-kid) & [the entity](https://artfight.net/character/1416706.the-entity)
Designs that spawned from [the cringetober challenge](https://www.deviantart.com/nightauctor/gallery?q=%23cringetober). I probably could have listed them together, but I didn't realize that was a Thing at the time and now I'd kinda hate to hide one, so <span style="display:inline-block;">¯\\\_(&nbsp;:V&nbsp;)_/¯</span>

## ["wolf-skull"](https://artfight.net/character/2143321.wolf-skull)
> This was supposed to be a minor character in one of my projects, except I like the design a disproportionate amount <span style="display:inline-block;">/o\\</span> I’m still not 100% sold on how they’ll appear in-story, but I wanted to add someone new to the roster for 2022 so <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">here</em>
> - A cocky adult human perpetually seen in a canid skull mask (only covers upper half). Sometimes wields a baseball bat.
> - Showy and confident. Talks the talk about teamwork, but would turn on an ally without regrets if deemed necessary. Likes winning, despises weakness, and invigorated by chaos.
> - In other words this is the person in <i>Among Us</i> who’s yelling “<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">sus</em>” at everyone at the slightest provocation.
> - Exists in a barren, sometimes-hazy hellscape that looks something like [this](https://artbreeder.b-cdn.net/imgs/318375766bb98460f5ee0288dd21.jpeg).
