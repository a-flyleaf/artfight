## sitenotes
· re-exported all non-transparent defenses as a HQ jpeg; highres versions are onsite (and saved locally)
· caption links open in new tabs
· username+socmed info up to date as of site update, will not be stalked
	· Y1: 9/25/2021
· chronological order

· unsure how 2022 will be handled site-nav-wise but it shouuuld be forward-compatible... I like that the attack & defense numbers worked out (4/8), will probably keep those intact regardless
· separate sub-pages for attacks and defenses could work tbh; the about and homepage are the main ":Tc" points
· ^ will delete these notes when I figure it out probably

## some fun and cool numbers
	side note: points are an absolute crapshoot, between me rating things inconsistently and the point values being adjusted year-to-year anyway. that said I Like Numbers so here they are anyway
