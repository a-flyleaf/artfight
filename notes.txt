## sitenotes
· re-exported all non-transparent defenses as a HQ jpeg; highres versions are onsite (and saved locally)
· caption links open in new tabs
· username+socmed info up to date as of site update, will not be stalked
	· Y1: 9/25/2021
· chronological order

· unsure how 2022 will be handled site-nav-wise but it shouuuld be forward-compatible... I like that the attack & defense numbers worked out (4/8), will probably keep those intact regardless
· separate sub-pages for attacks and defenses could work tbh; the about and homepage are the main ":Tc" points
· ^ will delete these notes when I figure it out probably

· trying to use yml data to record Everything; instead of separating attacks/defenses the site can use a "if artist = NightAuctor" thing to distinguish *my* art. could make for a fun general chronological overview and such
· time (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is *as displayed on ArtFight*; only the year and day really matter but this should help with order

## some fun and cool numbers
	side note: points are an absolute crapshoot, between me rating things inconsistently and both categories and their point values being adjusted year-to-year. that said I Like Numbers so here they are anyway \o/

### Y1 2021
· 40 total attacks (24 atk / 16 def)
	· 7 of my attacks were friendly fires
· 16 total artists (self included)

· battle ratio: 60%, 757.75 points

…actually I should just use a spreadsheet for this :V
